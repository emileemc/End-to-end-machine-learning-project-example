### End-to-end-machine-learning-project-example

This is an example of an end-to-end machine learning project. In this notebook, I will present how to tackle a typical machine learning problem and the ways / tools you can use to solve it.
In this example, I will use the dataset used in the challenge "Meilleur data scientist de France" (the best data scientist in France). It is a regression problem where the goal is to predict the price of a drug before its introdcution to the market based on multiple features (for example, the substances the drug contains). You can find more information here : https://www.datascience.net/fr/challenge/25/details
This project aims to introduce to ML beginners the following subject:
- how to work a regression predictive problem end-to-end
- how to transform data in order to improve model performance
- how to tune ML algorithms to also improve performance
